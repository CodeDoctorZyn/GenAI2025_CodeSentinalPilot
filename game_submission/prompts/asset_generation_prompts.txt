Design simple, flat SVG/PNG assets for a waste-sorting game:
1) Three bins: Recycle (green), Compost (lime), Landfill (amber). Labels readable on light backgrounds. High contrast, WCAG AA compliant.
2) 24 item icons (banana peel, aluminium can, glass bottle, paper towel, soft plastic wrapper, coffee cup, cup lid, etc.). Minimalist, recognisable silhouettes.
3) A clean background texture or pattern that wonâ€™t distract from items.
4) Icon sizes: 64x64 and 128x128 variants. Keep stroke widths consistent.
5) Export as SVG preferred; provide PNG fallbacks.
